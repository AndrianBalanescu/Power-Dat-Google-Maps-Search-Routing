Make a quick search on Google Maps from Power.DAT   loadboard.

Select&search
---

I created this chrome extension for personal use when i was dispatching trucks.

It allows you to select an address, right click and search it on Google Maps directly.

It's been modified to strip down numbers for easy selection on power dat!

Save time and a lot of typing
Enjoy

( the built in powerdat maping sucks, that's why ...)
